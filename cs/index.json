O 1,5 roku později, začátkem 2019 se mi podařilo najít mou nynější pozici jako back end Node.js vývojář. V samostudiu nadále pokračuji a má nová pozice back end vývojáře mě baví. Nedávno jsem se zaměřil na cloud technologie které v naší firmě používáme (Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm).\nZačátkem 2018 jsem zkusil Linux Mint a rychle jsem přešel z Windowsu do světa svobodného softwaru. To doporučuji každému uživateli pc.\nJedním z mých nejstarších koníčků je desková hra Go. Vedl jsem go klub v Děčíně kde jsme měli členy, studenty, webové stránky a každoroční celostátní turnaj po dobu 4 let (2011 - 2014).\nDěkuji za návštěvu mých stránek 😄\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"cs","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/cs/author/radim-janos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cs/author/radim-janos/","section":"authors","summary":"Vyrůstal jsem se v částečně německé rodině v Děčíně.

Half a year later I knew that this is the system for me and I felt an obligation to give back to the community something. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready yet to contribute code to some specific project, but there was one thing that put me in a special category. I am using Japanese input on the pc sometimes and when it became broken in Linux Mint 19, I felt an opportunity to contribute. Also, I never made a YouTube video before and I wanted to learn a little about video editing on linux.\nFor the desktop capture I used OBS studio. This is probably the by far the easiest and best choice. There is also \u0026ldquo;simple screen recorder\u0026rdquo;, which will do the job if you don\u0026rsquo;t need to manage any windows and you want only a \u0026ldquo;simple screen recording\u0026rdquo; as the name suggests. But chances are, especially if you want to continue making videos, OBS is the better choice and it is simple enough to use even for simple recordings.\nThe bigger question was what video editor to use. Here the answer is much less clear cut (pun intended). The top free recommendations, in this order, are probably Kdenlive and Shotcut. If for some reason both don\u0026rsquo;t work for you well, there are many other options. Another simple editor is OpenShot, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like too much, or also \u0026ldquo;DaVinci resolve\u0026rdquo;, which got very popular, but is catered more towards professional editing with emphasis on color adjustment and might be more than you need for simple video cutting. If you google \u0026ldquo;free video editors\u0026rdquo; you will get a plethora of top 10s, but take them always with a grain of salt. There is always bias in those rankings.\nIn my case, Kdenlive did the job well. I just edited some small parts, added a fitting free music track into the background and rendered.\nIn conclusion, were I to redo the video today, I would still use the same tools, but I would do it on a better machine. Preferably with a good microphone. It was done on an old laptop, and recording while running a virtual machine can be an issue. I would also make more small recording/edit samples, to make sure that the final result will have a high resolution, which mine was lacking. Also, a lesson was, that when doing a video, where text is of importance, it\u0026rsquo;s always better to scale up system text, to make it more visible to viewers.\n   \nPS: The main bug that convinced me to make the video was announced to be fixed just a couple of days after my video was done. I was pleasantly surprised that this issue didn\u0026rsquo;t go unnoticed by the developers. I talked briefly with Clem, the main developer of Linux Mint and tested the fix when the beta came out. The video is not only about the installation and bug fix, but talks also about how to setup and use the Japanese input, so I think it can still be useful and I kept it online.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"cs","lastmod":1595030400,"objectID":"1c56f4bb1407eb68b25dc256493ae0e5","permalink":"/cs/project/video/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cs/project/video/","section":"project","summary":"Dabbling in video editing on linux.","tags":["Linux"],"title":"Making a video","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Go je již dlouho mou velkou vášni. Když jsem ještě bydlel v Děčíně, kde jsem vyrůstal, podařilo se mi vytvořit malý go klub kde se naši členové mohli jednou týdně sejít a společně se učit, hrát a diskutovat o go. Měl jsem pár prezentací o historii a pravidlech go ve školách, na místních festivalech a v čajovnách.\nBěhem 2011-2014 jsme pořádali celonárodní turnaj každé jaro. Níže je pár fotek. Obzvlášť turnaj 2013 byl významný. Turnaj byl kvalifikací na mistrovství republiky. Měli jsme hráče co přijeli i z Německa, Rakouska a Slovenska. Zmínění v místním tisku nás potěšilo.\nNa konci 2014, po mém návratu z 6 měsíčního studijního pobytu v Jižní Korei, jsem se přestěhoval do Prahy za prací. Opustil jsem go klub který jsem založil, ale s radostí na ty roky vzpomínám. Jsem na sebe hrdý že jsem mohl lásku ke go šířit nejen v místě kde jsem vyrůstal, ale také že jsem měl možnost byť jen trochu podpořit go komunitu v celých Čechách.\nTurnaje (2010 - 2014)             Klubové aktivity (2007 - 2014)         ","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"cs","lastmod":1594684800,"objectID":"1198ce62c4940df230a9c3deeabf6166","permalink":"/cs/project/go_club/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cs/project/go_club/","section":"project","summary":"Náhled do mého šíření go v mých mladších letech.","tags":["Go"],"title":"Go klub a organizace turnajů","type":"project"},{"authors":["Radim Janoš","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
