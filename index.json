I continue to learn new things and I enjoy my path as a back end developer. Recently I started focusing on cloud (Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm), since we are actively using it in the company.\nEarly 2018 I tried Linux Mint and I quickly switched over from Windows and became a big Linux and free software advocate.\nOne of my biggest and oldest hobbies is the game of go. I was managing a local go club with students, a self-made website, and we were organizing a yearly nationwide tournament for 4 years (2011 – 2014).\nThank you for visiting my page 😄\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/radim-janos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/radim-janos/","section":"authors","summary":"I grew up in a half Czech, half German family in north Czech Republic.
