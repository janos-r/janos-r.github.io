I continue to learn new things and I enjoy my path as a back end developer. Recently I started focusing on cloud (Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm), since we are actively using it in the company.\nEarly 2018 I tried Linux Mint and I quickly switched over from Windows and became a big Linux and free software advocate.\nOne of my biggest and oldest hobbies is the game of go. I was managing a local go club with students, a self-made website, and we were organizing a yearly nationwide tournament for 4 years (2011 ‚Äì 2014).\nThank you for visiting my page üòÑ\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/radim-janos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/radim-janos/","section":"authors","summary":"I grew up in a half Czech, half German family in north Czech Republic.

Half a year later I knew that this is the system for me and I felt an obligation to give back to the community something. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready yet to contribute code to some specific project, but there was one thing that put me in a special category. I am using Japanese input on the pc sometimes and when it became broken in Linux Mint 19, I felt an opportunity to contribute. Also, I never made a YouTube video before and I wanted to learn a little about video editing on linux.\nFor the desktop capture I used OBS studio. This is probably the by far the easiest and best choice. There is also \u0026ldquo;simple screen recorder\u0026rdquo;, which will do the job if you don\u0026rsquo;t need to manage any windows and you want only a \u0026ldquo;simple screen recording\u0026rdquo; as the name suggests. But chances are, especially if you want to continue making videos, OBS is the better choice and it is simple enough to use even for simple recordings.\nThe bigger question was what video editor to use. Here the answer is much less clear cut (pun intended). The top free recommendations, in this order, are probably Kdenlive and Shotcut. If for some reason both don\u0026rsquo;t work for you well, there are many other options. Another simple editor is OpenShot, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like too much, or also \u0026ldquo;DaVinci resolve\u0026rdquo;, which got very popular, but is catered more towards professional editing with emphasis on color adjustment and might be more than you need for simple video cutting. If you google \u0026ldquo;free video editors\u0026rdquo; you will get a plethora of top 10s, but take them always with a grain of salt. There is always bias in those rankings.\nIn my case, Kdenlive did the job well. I just edited some small parts, added a fitting free music track into the background and rendered.\nIn conclusion, were I to redo the video today, I would still use the same tools, but I would do it on a better machine. Preferably with a good microphone. It was done on an old laptop, and recording while running a virtual machine can be an issue. I would also make more small recording/edit samples, to make sure that the final result will have a high resolution, which mine was lacking. Also, a lesson was, that when doing a video, where text is of importance, it\u0026rsquo;s always better to scale up system text, to make it more visible to viewers.\n   \nPS: The main bug that convinced me to make the video was announced to be fixed just a couple of days after my video was done. I was pleasantly surprised that this issue didn\u0026rsquo;t go unnoticed by the developers. I talked briefly with Clem, the main developer of Linux Mint and tested the fix when the beta came out. The video is not only about the installation and bug fix, but talks also about how to setup and use the Japanese input, so I think it can still be useful and I kept it online.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595030400,"objectID":"1c56f4bb1407eb68b25dc256493ae0e5","permalink":"/project/video/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/video/","section":"project","summary":"Dabbling in video editing","tags":["Linux"],"title":"YouTube video","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Go has been for a long time one of my big passions. When I was still living in Dƒõƒç√≠n, the town where I grew up in, I managed to set up a club, where a few members were meeting once a week to learn, play and discuss go together. I also did a few presentations about go (its history and rules) in high schools, local festivals and tea houses.\nDuring 2011-2014 we were holding a nationwide tournament every Spring. Bellow are a few pictures. Especially the tournament 2013 was important, as it was the qualification for that year\u0026rsquo;s national championship. We hosted a few international players from neighboring countries and had a small column in the local newspaper about it.\nLater 2014, after I got back from my 6 month exchange student program in South Korea, I moved to Prague for a better job. I left the go club that I started in my hometown, but I will always remember those years with joy. I am very proud that I could spread the love of go in my hometown, but also that I was able to give back and support a little the go community in my country.\nTournaments (2010 - 2014)             Club activities (2007 - 2014)         ","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594684800,"objectID":"1198ce62c4940df230a9c3deeabf6166","permalink":"/project/go_club/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/go_club/","section":"project","summary":"A look into my humble go evangelism in my younger years.","tags":["Go"],"title":"Go club and Tournament organization","type":"project"},{"authors":["Radim Jano≈°","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
